## Windows Terminal ‚èπ

`wt.exe`/Windows Terminal cannot run commands in an existing Terminal Window. [[1]](#References). Below is a workaround for it. 

To start multiple tabs with Ubuntu's terminal and with different destinations:
1. Create a batch file, say `wsl.bat`, with following command 
2. run it in Command Prompt.  

*This will open tabs in Windows Terminal and closes the current Command Prompt Window.  
**Note:** Modify the command for respective needs.*  

`start wt nt -p "Ubuntu-20.04" -d "\\wsl$\Ubuntu-20.04\home\<user>\folder1" ; nt -p "Ubuntu-20.04" -d "\\wsl$\Ubuntu-20.04\home\<user>\folder2";`

Tab Navigation shortcuts are same as that of Mac's-Terminal's/Chrome's Tab but instead of `CMD` key hit `Ctrl+Shift`  
*i.e.* `^‚áßw` *for closing the terminal window.*

When encountering *"Unable to connect to github.com"* or *"unable to resolve host address"* errors  
*(could happen when doing `wget -c https://github.com/ogham/exa/releases/download/v0.10.0/exa-linux-x86_64-v0.10.0.zip` or `git pull`)*

change `nameserver 174.23.23.1` to `nameserver 1.1.1.1` in `/etc/resolv.conf`  
additionally, add `generateResolvConf =  false` in `/etc/wsl.conf`
